#### Code examples: 

As a matter of fact I want to show you my code-example: 


``` 
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace DucksInDucks
{
    class Duck
    {
        public int Size { get; set; }
        public KindOfDuck Kind { get; set; }
    }
    enum KindOfDuck
    {
        Mallard,
        Muscovy,
        Loon,
    }
    internal class Program
    {
        public static void PrintDucks(List<Duck> ducks)
        {
            foreach (Duck duck in ducks)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{duck.Size} inch {duck.Kind}");

            }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Duck> ducks = new List<Duck>()
            {
                new Duck() { Kind = KindOfDuck.Mallard, Size = 17 },
                new Duck() { Kind = KindOfDuck.Muscovy, Size = 18 },
                new Duck() { Kind = KindOfDuck.Loon, Size = 14 },
                new Duck() { Kind = KindOfDuck.Muscovy, Size = 11 },
                new Duck() { Kind = KindOfDuck.Mallard, Size = 14 },
                new Duck() { Kind = KindOfDuck.Loon, Size = 13 },
            };
            PrintDucks(ducks);
        }

    }

} 
```
